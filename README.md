**"Can it truly be? Now that this revolution has finally been reached NO LONGER shall killboxes remain silent, now they will be able to tell tales of desperation, of war crimes, of tribal genocide with simple sound queues, you will be able to craft a sonorous masterpiece from the screams of your foes as they march fourth playing Lacrimosa with their tiny feets." **
-RoqueTheRoque, RimWorld Discord Server

Have you ever wished your killboxes would play melodies as raiders flooded in towards their death? Maybe you just want a little *extra* by hearing your pawns move around the billiard table? Perhaps, you just want a simple doorbell.  Whatever your auditory ailment, this mod shall provide the cure!

Costing only 10 steel and requiring no electricity, you can arrange 12 piano notes ranging from A to G#, placeable anywhere a pawn would be able to walk, allowing for a diverse set of locations to hear the beautiful notes.
Each note is in 5th Octave

ToDo:
- Add the rest of the octaves
